    <p> 
        Savory chickpea flour pancakes, also known as socca, require just four ingredients (including water) and are packed with protein. 
        The kale-fennel salad with tahini dressing is a fresh, bright complement but is also delicious on its own.

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup chickpea flour</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, divided</li>
        <li>1 15-oz. can chickpeas, drained</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. za'atar (or curry powder, chile powder, or frankly any other combination of mild dried ground spices)</li>
        <li>1 small bunch kale, stemmed, leaves torn</li>
        <li>1 small fennel bulb (or bell pepper), very thinly sliced crosswise</li>
        <li> ¼ cup tahini</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Whisk chickpea flour, 1 Tbsp. oil, a pinch of salt, and ½ cup water in a medium bowl. 
            Let socca batter sit at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour to let flour hydrate.

            Meanwhile, heat 2 Tbsp. oil and 2 garlic cloves in a medium nonstick skillet over medium, tossing occasionally, until garlic is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. 
            Add chickpeas and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, tossing occasionally, until chickpeas are lightly browned, 6–8 minutes. 
            Add za’atar and toss several times to coat chickpeas; season with salt. 
            Add kale and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until kale wilts, about 2 minutes. 
            Transfer to a medium bowl, add fennel, and toss to combine. <strong>Reserve skillet.</strong>
        </li>
            
        <li>
            Finely grate remaining garlic clove into a small bowl. 
            Whisk in tahini, lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 2 Tbsp. water until thick and smooth. 
            Season with salt.
        </li>
            
        <li>
            Heat 1½ tsp. oil in reserved skillet over medium-high. 
            Add half of reserved socca batter to center of skillet and tilt skillet so that it spreads out to a thin 6"–7" pancake. 
            Cook, undisturbed, until well browned and crisp underneath, 2–3 minutes (crank up the heat to high if needed to get crunchy edges and nice browning). 
            Turn and cook just until lightly browned on second side, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. 
            Repeat with remaining 1½ tsp. oil and batter.
        </li>
            
        <li> 
            Top each socca with chickpea salad. Drizzle with tahini sauce. <em>Be generous!</em>
